# Datathon-FME
Datathon FME

GitHub repository of the team _PasDeGalère_ composed by Ibrahim Braham, Eric Diez, Matteo Boursault and Raphaël Vignon. We chose to work on the subject proposed by **Accenture**.
The main purpose of the subject was to understand main root-cause affecting supply chain deliveries and to predict product delays based on historical inbound/outbound orders of the company. This would help in providing visibility of supply chain resiliency to maximize customer service levels.

Two things was expected from us :
* Provide data insights based on descriptive analytics of historical data
* Regression model to predict likelihood of order delay

## Respository Description

This repository contains one main jupyter notebook which was used on **Kaggle** to get our best score **_0.80335_**. The is also a folder entitled data which is filled with the projects data and some data crated by us to meet our needs.
